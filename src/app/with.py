# Use of with.

# Key takeaways:
# - Simplify exception handling - encapsulate try/finally in context manager.
# - Safe aquisition and release of system resources. Resources acquired and
#   released automatically as part of entering and exiting the with context.
# - Avoid resource leaks and make code easier to read.
